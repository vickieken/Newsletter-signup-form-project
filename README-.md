## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

In the course of this project, I learnt how to validate an email form and also how to make proper use of the addevenlistener in javascript

Below are some of my code snippets:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
subEl.addeventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
})
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I look forward to getting used to work more with javaScript syntaxes so I can get better at it...
